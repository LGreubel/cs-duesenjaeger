# What this Project is about


Our project idea is an 'old school' textadventure that uses a fantasy themed script to tell a short story.
To do that we implemented a 'map' where multiple locations of the story are placed in.
The player is offered multiple pre-programmed choices at different location to play.
For example to enter a specific location on the map, you can go 'north', to enter a new location.
