*own notes
-changes   - changed and added some dialogue
	   - added some more command options
!concerns  - concerned about dialogue options if game is played in different order (for example: ending prompt if you've never seen ghorkan, but strike him down with the enchanted sword)
	   - need to add an easteregg (probably hidden dialogue prompt with an object, for example: trying to talk to Typhon or Ghorkan multiple times to annoy them)
	   - command in castle regarding "talk to noblemen" if he "leaves" you can still talk to him (makes little sense)
